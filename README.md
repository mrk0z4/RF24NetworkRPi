RF24NetworkRPi
==============

An implementation of RF24Network for Raspberry Pi.

This is based on the library for Arduino from https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24Network and https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24/, so everything needed to operate with nRF24L01+ modules is already included.

Because I found nothing regarding this library for Raspberry Pi, except for one fork (but it didn't satisfied me and the developer was inactive), I started to translate those minor details that prevented the library to run on the Raspberry Pi.

Anyway, my efforts turned my goal into reality.

==============

I've ported only the meshping example, but I plan to port the others ASAP.

If you have a problem regarding this library, please report it. At my free time, I'll give it a look.
